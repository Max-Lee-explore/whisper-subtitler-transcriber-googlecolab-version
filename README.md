## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- T4 GPU runtime
- Internet connection for YouTube downloads

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: The free Colab tier has limitations on GPU usage time. Consider upgrading for longer processing times if you have large batch transcription tasks.

## File Size Limits

- Maximum file size: 2GB
- Files exceeding this limit will be rejected
- File sizes are displayed in human-readable format

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: For longer videos, consider splitting them into smaller segments.

## Output Files

- Text transcription: `[filename]_transcription.txt`
- Subtitles: `[filename]_subtitles.srt`
- Files are saved in the current Colab session
- Download button appears after generation

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Always download your files before closing the Colab session, as files are temporarily stored.

## Notes

- The process requires a GPU for optimal performance
- Larger models provide better accuracy but take longer to process
- Initial prompts can help improve accuracy for specific content
- All files are temporarily stored in the Colab session

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: For best results with technical content, provide an initial prompt with relevant terminology.

## Troubleshooting

1. **GPU Not Found**
   - Go to Runtime -> Change runtime type
   - Select GPU as Hardware accelerator
   - Choose T4 GPU

   > ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If GPU is not available, try refreshing the page or waiting a few minutes.

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check file format is supported
   - Ensure file size is under 2GB
   - Try refreshing the page if upload fails

   > ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If upload fails, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.

3. **Download Issues**
   - Check internet connection
   - Try using a different YouTube URL
